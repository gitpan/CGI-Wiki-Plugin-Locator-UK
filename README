NAME
    CGI::Wiki::Plugin::Locator::UK - A CGI::Wiki plugin to manage UK
    location data.

DESCRIPTION
    Access to and calculations using British National Grid location metadata
    supplied to a CGI::Wiki wiki when writing a node. (For converting
    between British National Grid co-ordinates and latitude/longitude, you
    may wish to look at Geography::NationalGrid.)

    Note: This is *read-only* access. If you want to write to a node's
    metadata, you need to do it using the "write_node" method of CGI::Wiki.
