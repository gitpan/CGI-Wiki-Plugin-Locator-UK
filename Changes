        Simplified tests with the use of the new test utilities available
          in CGI::Wiki 0.27.

0.02    17 March 2003
        Fixed bug that had tests failing on some earlier versions of
          postgres (with help from Marcel Gruenauer).
        Simplified the SQL in ->find_within_distance since the bug in
          CGI::Wiki with metadata hanging around too long is fixed in 0.23.

0.01    28 October 2002
        Initial release.
